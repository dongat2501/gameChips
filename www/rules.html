                                4. SWEEPSTAKES DRAWING: Administrator will select the potential Sweepstakes winners in a
                                random drawing from among all eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Period
                                through both entry methods combined. The drawing will be conducted on or around August
                                11, 2020. Each potential winner who entered through Instagram will be notified by
                                @chipsahoy after the date of the drawing and will direct each to a secure site to
                                collect their name, email address, home mailing address and date of birth, which must be
                                submitted within three (3) days of the date of notice in order to be deemed the winner.
                                Any potential winner who entered through the mail-in method will receive a notification
                                by email. If: a potential winner cannot be contacted or fails to provide any requested
                                information within the required time period; a prize notification is returned as
                                undeliverable; or a potential winner does not comply with these Official Rules in any
                                way, the potential winner will be disqualified and will forfeit the award. Odds of being
                                selected as a winner will depend on the number of eligible entries received during the
                                Sweepstakes Period through both methods of entry. In the event that a potential winner
                                is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor will select an an alternate winner by random
                                drawing from among all remaining eligible entries. If necessary, only three (3) such
                                alternate drawings will be held, after which the prize will not be awarded if it remains
                                unclaimed.

                                Sweepstakes, or by any human error which may occur in the transmission, receipt, and
                                processing of the entries in this Sweepstakes. If, in the opinion of Sponsor or
                                Administrator, there is any suspected evidence of tampering with any portion of the
                                Sweepstakes that compromises the integrity of the Sweepstakes, or if technical or other
                                difficulties compromise the integrity of the Sweepstakes, the Sponsor reserves the right
                                to modify or terminate the Sweepstakes in a manner deemed reasonable by the Sponsor, at
                                the Sponsor’s sole discretion. If the Sweepstakes is terminated prior to the stated end
                                date, prizes will be awarded in a random drawing using all non-suspect entries as of the

                                Sweepstakes Period. <br />

                                All income taxes resulting from acceptance of prizes, if any, are the responsibility of

                                (a) if entry was made through Instagram, the authorized Instagram account holder who is
                                billed for the phone account used to enter will be the potential winner (subject to
